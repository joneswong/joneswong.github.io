## Basic Concepts

"Hilbert Space Structure" in Lec3:

> The space of signals is a vector space! (possibly infinite dimensional)

where `vector space` is a set that is closed under finite vector addition and scalar multiplication.

> The space of signals is a Hilbert space!

where `Hilbert space` is a vector space with an inner product $<f, g>$ such that the norm defined by $|f|=\sqrt{<f,f>}$ turns the vector space into a complete metric space or an inner product space (depends on whether this norm is complete).
