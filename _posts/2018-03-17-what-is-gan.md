#What is GAN?
GAN is a framework for estimating generative models (mainly multi-layer neural perceptrons). Recall that a generative model is tasked to estimate the distribution of random variable x. It has two components:
 
   * A generative model: a function G maps random noise z to sample x.
  * A discriminative model: discriminate between a true sample x versus a G(z).
