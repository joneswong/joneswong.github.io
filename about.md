## Zhen Wang
I am currently a researcher working for DAMO Academy. During the years of my Ph.D. (as an intern at MSRA), I have pursued the goal of embedding everything (entity, word, sentence, paragraph, etc.). In my experience as an engineer for Alibaba Cloud, I have been lucky to work with people from RISELab who kindly acknowledge my contributions and let me become a committer of Ray. I have a broad interest in machine learning. At the moment, our team is focused on federated learning and working on platforms, benchmarks, and research problems that are related to it.
